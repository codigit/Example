                <h2>The Lincoln's Gettusburg Address 1865</h2>
                <p>Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any other nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
                
                Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any other natio so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on the great battle field of that war and we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.
                
                It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, but in a larger sense, we can not consecrate we cannot dedicate we cannot hallow this ground, the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note what we say here but can never forget what they did here.
                
                It is for us the living rather to be here dedicate to the unfinished work which they who fought here have done far nobly advance, it is rather jfor us to be dedicated that from these honoured dead, we shall take increase devotion to that cause to which they gave their last full measure of devotion and that we here highly resolve tht this dead shall not have died in vain and that this nation under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the people for the people and by the people shall not perish on the earth.</p>
