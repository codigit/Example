                <h2>The Lincoln's Gettusburg Address 1865</h2>
                <p>Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any other nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure.
                
                Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any other natio so conceived and so dedicated can long endure. We are met on the great battle field of that war and we have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that this nation might live.
                
                It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this, but in a larger sense, we can not consecrate we cannot dedicate we cannot hallow this ground, the brave men living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note what we say here but can never forget what they did here.</p>
